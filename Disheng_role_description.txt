Disheng: I contributed to build up the dataset for those users having ratings. 
Then I build up the matrix completion model to predict the missing entries. 
After that I revised the model for linear regression by adding the intercept which if not added the regression result would be incorrect. 
Lastly, I constructed the final prediction dataset and transformed it into cvs file.

Jacque: She did made PCA clusters and constructed the PCA features dataset.
Also, she checked errors and language of coding. She wrote Readme


Gretchen: She did PCA clusters and k-means. She also found the eigenvalues that are most significant.
She also wrote the report for our project.

Baihe: She also contributed to compute PCA and k-means preparing the dataset for linear regression.

Siyuan: He contributed to run linear regression making plots, checked errors and revised language,
wrote report, and updated our project.
